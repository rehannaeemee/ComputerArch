This testbench tests all the functional units of a single cycle processor separately.
The functional units are assumed not to be connected to each other.
The functional units and their port names are assumed to be the same as in figure 4.21 of the textbook "Computer Organization and Design RISCV Edition" by Henessey Patterson.
